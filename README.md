# proj4_gender_analysis

Analysis for trust in different political parties in the EU across gender. It is a group project, but I solely own this section; we incorporated the results into the final report afterward. 

Skills demonstrated: 
- Using pandas to clean and parse the data.
- Report in JupyterNotebook, and display bar graphs for the analysis using matplotlib
